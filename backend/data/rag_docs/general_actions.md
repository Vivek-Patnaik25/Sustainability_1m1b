# General Sustainability Best Practices

**For Individuals and Communities:**
1.  **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:** Always prioritize reducing waste first, then reusing items, and finally recycling.
2.  **Report Issues:** engaging with local authorities (municipalities) via official channels is critical for systemic change.
3.  **Community Action:** Organizing local clean-up drives, tree planting, or awareness campaigns.
4.  **Conserve Resources:** Fixing leaks, turning off lights, and using public transport.
5.  **Education:** Educating neighbors and family about specific sustainability targets creates a multiplier effect.
